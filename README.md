# A peak into Robot Planning and Control
This notebook serves as an introductory guide to planning and control algorithms commonly used in robotics. We begin with state estimationâ€”not a planning or control technique per se, but a fundamental prerequisite for building autonomous systems. Next, we explore grid-based planners such as A* and Uniform Cost Search (UCS), followed by the implementation of a PID controller to enable the robot to follow planned waypoints. We then transition into sampling-based planning algorithms, and gradually delve into optimal control methods ranging from Quadratic Programming (QP) to Model Predictive Control (MPC) and MPC with Control Barrier Functions (MPC-CBF), which are widely used in autonomous robotics. This tutorial is designed to be accessible for beginners and also introduces powerful optimization libraries like cvxpy and CasADi.
